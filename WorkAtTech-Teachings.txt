1) The questions "K difference pair" is very important. (See in the Two Sums wala question)

2) Detect a Loop in a Linked list base conditions are very important. (See in the AmazonGeeks section for that)

3) Types of questions and their variations needed to be studied together.

  1) -Longest Common Subsequence <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>> -Longest Common Substring + (both their printing techniques)
  2) -Longest Palindromic Subsequence(LCS variation) <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>> -Longest Palindromic Substring(newer technique)
  3) -Count Number of Palindromic Subsequences (DP question) <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>> -Count Number of Palindromic Sustring (similar to L.P Substring question)
  4) -Count No. of Palindromic partitions needed (MCM type, DP question) <<<<<>>>>> -Print all the Palindromic Partitions(like Permutation from WorkAtTech)
  5) -Maximum Coin Change Problem(DP type) <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>> Combination Sum(I and II), from Amazon List


4) Do these Array type questions together

   1) Minimize Heights, Gas Station, Minimum number of Jumps,Frogs Cracking,
   2) Sudoku Solver, Maximum Number in K swaps, Minimum number of Swaps to Sort, Generate Parenthesis.
   3) Kadane's Algo, Kth Largest Contiguous Sum
   4) Rotate List(Array) and Rotate List(Linked List), both in O(1) Space
   5) Convert Sorted Array/Linked List to Binary Search tree.

5) Rotate a non-square matrix
6) Do the "TrainsAndPlatforms" question.
7) Inorder Successor of a Node. (V.V.Imp)
